# BookBot - A Text Analysis Tool

*BookBot* is a Python-powered text analysis tool that reads any text file and generates a comprehensive report on its word count and the frequency of each letter. Originally built to analyse the novel *Frankenstein*, it can be used for any text file of your choice.

### Key Features:
- **Analyse any text**: Reads any `.txt` file and provides an analysis of its contents.
- **Word count**: Quickly counts the total number of words in the document.
- **Letter frequency**: Breaks down the frequency of each letter in the alphabet, perfect for analysing patterns in text.
- **Customisable**: You can modify the project to work with other texts, making it adaptable for various uses, from literary analysis to technical writing.

### How It Works:
1. The bot reads the text file you provide.
2. It counts how many words are in the file.
3. It tallies the occurrence of each letter (case-insensitive) and sorts them by frequency.
4. Outputs a detailed report showing:
   - Total word count.
   - Letter frequency in descending order of occurrence.

### Why I Built This:
This project was designed to test and expand my skills in:
- **Python**: String manipulation, file handling, and dictionaries.
- **Shell scripting and Git**: Working with command-line tools and version control.
- **Problem-solving**: Consulting online resources and mentors to overcome obstacles.
